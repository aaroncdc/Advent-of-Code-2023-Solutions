This repository contains my solutions to the AoC 2023 problems, written in Python.

Each day is in it's respective folder, named DayX (where X is the day, from 1 to 25).

Each part of the problem is in it's own script, usually named aocX_Y.py (where X is the day and
Y is the part, 1 or 2). Some might have an underscore _Z, where Z is the version (normally I do
this when I have to rewrite the entire thing).

The puzzle parts are in TXT files. Some include a _test puzzle that contains the given example or
a custom puzzle piece used for debugging purposes.
